# Welcome to the Earth Metabolome Initiative Dendron notes

Dendron is the one of the knowledge management system we use in the EMI. Regarding Dendron we use it specifically to manage notes, lab-books and share ideas.
If you want to know more on Dendron, have a look at this section [[dendron.md]].

# What is the Earth Metabolome Initiative ?

The Earth Metabolome Initiative, abbreviated EMI is an Open Science initiative and a global effort to profile the metabolic content of all currently known species on our planet (~2.3 million species). We are building the required computational, scientific and organizational architecture to establish the network of ressources and humans to advance in this massive undertaking. The EMI will explore the chemical foundations of Life for a better human society within a thriving biosphere.

# How is it related to the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative ?

We have started the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative, abbreviated DBGI, as a pilot project for the EMI. You will be able to find more details on the DBGI at <https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi>


# An Open Science project

## Working with the garage door up

A way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu.

## Open Notebook Science

If we apply this "working with the garage door up" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of open-science. These are in fact the principles of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science

For the projects of the DBGI we will follow such approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. 
Expect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !
